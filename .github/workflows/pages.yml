# ✅ EXPERT-CONSENSUS FIX (ChatGPT O3 + Gemini 2.5 Pro)
# Problem: Multiple commits in quick succession (newsletter + index update)
#          triggered concurrent Pages deployments, causing cancellations
# Solution: Serialize deployments with cancel-in-progress: false
#          → Queue instead of cancel, ensuring every newsletter gets archived
concurrency:
  group: pages-deployment
  cancel-in-progress: false  # Critical: Queue deployments, don't cancel!
